## Tools Used

### React Native Navigation

React Native Navigation provides 100% native platform navigation on both iOS and Android for React Native apps.
React Native Navigation is a native navigation implementation, not a JavaScript based implementation. This means that the library will typically be more performant & have smoother interactions & screen transitions than some other solutions that are not native implementations.
